# PROGRESS LOG - Smart First Aid Kit Management System

**Project:** Gestión de Botiquines Inteligentes  
**Developer:** Jose Pacheco  
**Started:** September 2025  
**Current Status:** Post-meeting model updates and testing

## Context Refresh
This project is a software-only MVP for managing smart first aid kits (botiquines). Hardware will send data via Wi-Fi module ("SCP que tiene un módulo Wi-Fi") with weight, door, and infrared sensors. The software receives JSON data and displays medicine inventory with alerts.

## Meeting Requirements Implemented
Based on transcript meeting with Edgar Canul (boss) and Emilio Rafael Medina González (project owner):

### ✅ **SaaS Architecture**
- Multi-company system with `super_admin` and `company_admin` roles
- Each company can have multiple botiquines
- Proper access control and data isolation

### ✅ **Weight-Based Medicine Calculation** 
- Added `unit_weight` and `current_weight` fields to Medicine model
- Automatic quantity calculation: `quantity = current_weight / unit_weight`
- Method `update_from_sensor()` for hardware integration

### ✅ **Botiquin Management**
- Can add/remove botiquines from software interface
- Each botiquin has unique `hardware_id` for communication
- Compartment visualization (grid view) as requested

### ✅ **Hardware Integration Ready**
- Routes in `hardware.py` for receiving JSON data via Wi-Fi
- Endpoints: `/sensor_data`, `/batch_sensor_data`, `/test_connection`
- `HardwareLog` model for audit trail

## Today's Session Progress

### 🔧 **Fixed Issues**
1. **Typo in User Model**: `user_tyoe` → `user_type` (FIXED)
2. **Outdated seed.py**: Updated for SaaS structure with proper hierarchy

### 📝 **Updated seed.py**
- **NEW STRUCTURE**: Company → User, Company → Botiquin → Medicine
- **3 Companies**: Empresa Demo SA, Corporativo XYZ, plus test company
- **4 Users**: superadmin, demo, admin, xyzadmin with proper roles
- **3 Botiquines**: BOT001, BOT002 (Company 1), BOT003 (Company 2)
- **9 Medicines**: Covering all status types (EXPIRED, EXPIRES_SOON, OUT_OF_STOCK, LOW_STOCK, EXPIRES_30, OK)
- **Weight Integration**: All medicines have unit_weight and current_weight for sensor simulation

### 📊 **Test Data Coverage**
- ✅ **EXPIRED**: Paracetamol (expired 10 days ago)
- ✅ **EXPIRES_SOON**: Ibuprofeno (expires in 5 days) 
- ✅ **OUT_OF_STOCK**: Amoxicilina (quantity = 0)
- ✅ **LOW_STOCK**: Omeprazol (2 units, reorder at 10)
- ✅ **EXPIRES_30**: Loratadina (expires in 25 days)
- ✅ **OK**: Diclofenaco (20 units, expires in 300 days)

### 🔑 **Login Credentials**
- **Super Admin**: superadmin / super123
- **Demo User (Company 1)**: demo / demo123
- **Admin User (Company 1)**: admin / admin123  
- **XYZ Admin (Company 2)**: xyzadmin / xyz123

## Next Steps (Current Session)
1. **✅ DONE**: Fix user_type typo
2. **✅ DONE**: Update seed.py for SaaS structure
3. **✅ DONE**: Create PROGRESS_LOG.md
4. **✅ COMPLETED**: Fix frontend templates compatibility
   - ✅ **Fixed base.html**: Proper navigation with SaaS features
   - ✅ **Fixed dashboard.html**: Now extends base.html, shows botiquines grid
   - ✅ **Created botiquin_detail.html**: VISUAL COMPARTMENT REPRESENTATION (meeting requirement)
   - ✅ **Updated inventory.html**: Compatible with SaaS structure, shows all medicines across botiquines
   - ✅ **Fixed pages.py routes**: Grid data structure, proper inventory route, template compatibility
5. **🔄 IN PROGRESS**: Test application with new seed data
   - **Step 1**: ✅ Database populated successfully
   - **Step 2**: ❌ AUTHENTICATION BUGS FOUND:
     - **Security Issue**: Root URL bypasses login verification
     - **HTTP 415 Error**: Login form sends form data, route expects JSON
   - **Step 3**: 🔄 FIXING: Authentication and login flow (partially done)
6. **✅ DONE**: Implemented dynamic compartments grid in `botiquin_detail.html`, linked with `comp_map` from backend.
7. **✅ DONE**: Fixed compartment colors and medicine names displaying correctly.
8. **✅ DONE**: Updated `inventory.html` to group tables by company (superadmin) or by botiquín (company admin).
9. **✅ DONE**: Added `/botiquin/<id>/inventory` route in `pages.py` for table view of a single botiquín.
10. **✅ DONE**: Updated `botiquin_detail.html` to link "Vista Tabla" to new route instead of JSON endpoint.
11. **✅ DONE**: Refactored hardware.py to handle botiquín-level JSON with compartments array.
12. **🔄 NEXT**: Test new hardware endpoint with simulated JSON payload.
13. **🔄 NEXT**: Validate data flow from compartments array into Medicine updates.
14. **🔄 NEXT**: Document new API format in README.

## Hardware Integration Notes
**Wi-Fi Module**: "SCP que tiene un módulo Wi-Fi"  
**Expected JSON Format (MVP)**:
```json
{
  "hardware_id": "BOT001",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-23T10:30:00",
  "compartments": [
    {
      "compartment": 1,
      "weight": 45.5
    },
    {
      "compartment": 2,
      "weight": 30.0
    },
    {
      "compartment": 3,
      "weight": 0.0
    },
    {
      "compartment": 4,
      "weight": 18.2
    }
  ]
}
```
- The MVP will have 4 compartments per botiquín, but the design supports a variable number of compartments.
- Botiquín assignment to companies is handled manually by the superadmin via the dashboard.

**Hardware Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/hardware/sensor_data` - Full botiquín payload with compartments array
- `POST /api/hardware/test_connection` - Connection test
- `POST /api/hardware/register_hardware` - Register new botiquín
